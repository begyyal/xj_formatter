# What is this
Java formatter for VS Code Extension with **minimal** functionalities.  
This only provides indenting and spacing between elements.  
(As the goal, it will makes this like standard javascript formatter of VSCode.)

# Motivation
Certain vscode extension for java is so good, but just for simple formatting, what needs complicated procedure and external tools is too ridiculous.
