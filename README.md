# What is this
Java formatter for VSCode Extension with **minimal** functionalities.  
This only provides indenting and spacing between elements.  
(as the goal, it will makes this like standard javascript formatter of VSCode.)

# Install
1. clone this repository.
2. `npm i && npm run install:vsix`
3. select `begyyal.xj-formatter` as java formatter in VSCode preferences. 

### Why isn't this published to VSCode marketplace?
Because auther can't sign-up (or use) **all microsoft services** including azure-devops due to [**defective credit card authentication**](https://learn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/answers/questions/5216558/question-5216558).  

# Motivation
Certain vscode extension for java is so good, but just for simple change of the format setting, what needs complicated procedure and external tools is too ridiculous.
