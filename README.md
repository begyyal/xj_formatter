# What is this
Java formatter for VSCode Extension with **minimal** functionalities.  
This only provides indenting and spacing between elements.  
(as the goal, it will makes this like standard javascript formatter of VSCode.)

# Motivation
Certain vscode extension for java is so good, but just for simple change of the format setting, what needs complicated procedure and external tools is too ridiculous.  
(especially I think preferences including whether inserts redundant blank lines quite vary by person.  
if you prefer blank lines insertion enabled, probably you should use default formatter of the java language extension.)
